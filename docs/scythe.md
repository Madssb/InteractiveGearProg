# introduction

Scythe sequencing has as of late been the topic of discussion in the ironman progression chart. For most of its inclusion, its sequencing has been maximally conservative, simply prioritizing other
parts due to the difficulty in forecasting expected times for uniques in the raids.

# calcs

The expected amount of CoX points for a dexterous scroll is ~3 mil and for the scroll pair its ~4.5mil pts.

Hydra Avg. TTK is 91.7s with scythe, and 106.1s with fang for a 13% speedup, which saves four hours under the assumption that the player wants the lance.

Lance over whip at cox saves about 40s per raid, which amounts to ~1.1 hours saved for getting the dexterous prayer scroll, or ~1.7 for the scroll pair.
