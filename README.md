# Ladlor's Interactive Gear Progression Chart

An interactive chart for Old School RuneScape Ironman progression.  
Developed with the Ironscape Discord community to help players plan gear and skill unlocks in a clear, trackable order.

## Features

- **Interactive Tracking**: Click items or skills to mark them as acquired.
- **Progress Saved Locally**: Uses browser localStorage (no accounts, no servers).
- **Community Sequenced**: Based on collaborative theorycrafting and guides.
- **Pure Web**: Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks or backend.

## Usage

- **Live site**: [ladlorchart.com](https://ladlorchart.com)
- Click any item/skill to toggle completion.
- Hover (or long-press on mobile) for item names and Wiki links.
- To reset your progress: clear this siteâ€™s local storage in your browser.

## For developers

If you want to fork or adapt this project:

- The chart sequence is defined in `data/sequence.json`.
- Item metadata (`wikiUrl`/`imgUrl`) is stored in `data/generated/items.json`.
- This metadata is generated by `tools/build_items_json.py`, which queries the OSRS Wiki API (requires Python 3.10+).

ðŸ‘‰ For a **minimal, ready-to-fork template** (without site extras like changelog, FAQ, pagecount), see the [`minimal-template` branch](https://github.com/Madssb/InteractiveGearProg/tree/minimal-template).
