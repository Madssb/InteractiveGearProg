  "How do I use this tool?": "Click items you have completed to mark them green. Progress saves automatically.",
  "How is my progress saved?": "In your browser's local storage. It stays on this device and this browser only.",
  "Can I reset my progress?": "Yes. Clear this site's local storage. This also resets preferences like dark mode.",
  "Will new items break my saved progress?": "No. Each item has its own ID. Adding or reordering items will not flip existing states.",
  "What darts should I use with my blowpipe?": "Rune darts, or amethyst if available. Dragon for combat achievements. Do not use adamant or lower for anything else than tagging for barrage.",
  "Why is Slayer so late?": "Delaying lets you unlock strong tools first: barrage, prayer potions, better gear, and more. Slayer gets faster and smoother once these are in place.",
  "Why this order for Zenytes?": "Melee is used more than range for Slayer, so it is prioritized over Anguish. Tormented is not impactful for a while. Ring of suffering is broadly low impact.",
  "Why are Infernal cape and Quiver treated as end-game?": "The sequence shows how long they can be reasonably postponed before learning the content is recommended. It is not strictly optimal. If you can get them earlier, do it.",
  "Why is 98 Agility recommended?": "Early Hallowed Sepulchre gives strong loot and passive XP including roughly 45k law/blood/soul runes, 7k cosmic and nature runes, 8k death runes, 336 ranarr seeds, 72 strange lockpicks, 550k Thieving XP, 3.2m Magic XP, and 44k Construction XP.",
  "Where is Purging staff?": "Scorching bow and Purging staff share a synapse. Make whichever one you need at the time.",
  "Where are the Moons of Peril uniques?": "Omitted due to better options: Bloodbark is faster than blue moon set, strength legs are too minor, and Dual macuahuitl's crush niche is covered by Zamorakian hasta.",
  "Why is Barrows omitted?": "You still need one set for Achievement Diary cape. Beyond that, items are mostly obsolete except Dharok's for Grandmaster Combat Achievements.",
  "Why is Fire cape so late?": "If you also want Bowfa, doing Bowfa first keeps total time lower. The time loss is about an hour, so change the order if you prefer."
