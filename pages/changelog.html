    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.4.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scythe of Vitur has been moved to same sequencing group as Avernic defender, and Dizana's quiver has been seperated into its own sequence group just prior to the aforementioned tob items.</li>
        <li>Rite of vile transference (dc2) and Avernic Treads have been merged to signify their lack of cross-dependency, i.e. not mattering which one is first.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.4.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Replaced 98 agility step with hallowed crystal shard step, still encoding sep access in progression. Still implicitly assumes doing the minigame for the rewards</li>
        <li>Added link to BRUHSailer in acknowledgements</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.4.0</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Mokhiatl uniques.</li>
        <li>Added Arkan blade.</li>
        <li>Trident of the seas and trident of the swamp removed, outclassed by Eye of ayak.</li>
        <li>Agility step re-sequenced to match BRUHSailer.</li>
        <li>MTA items and ice barrage moved pre 69 slayer.</li>
        <li>Osmumten's fang postponed until pre-lance.</li>
        <li>Skip functionality added per contributions by "leonprz" on github.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.3.3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For avoiding scope-creep on the chart that is primarily pvm and slayer, diary items with little relevance
            for either are removed. These include: <ul>
                <li>Varrock armour,</li>
                <li>Kandarin headgear,</li>
                <li>Fremennik seaboots,</li>
                <li>Ardougne cape,</li>
                <li>and diary cape.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Removed log basket and plank sack for lacking pvm/slayer impact.</li>
        <li>Mixology rewards postponed until after slayer helm.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.3.2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tormented bracelet, Ring of suffering, and synapse weapons all moved into the major 80-90slayer block. They
            are postponed to account for ancient shard scarcity.</li>
        <li>Bandos hilt is identified as a pointless inclusion and as a result is dropped.</li>
        <li>Soulreaper axe is removed. Too niche, and left to player discretion.</li>
        <li>tweaked title and added subtitle to more accurately reflect authorship</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.3.1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ring of suffering moved to immediately pre-zulrah.</li>
        <li>Bandos chestplate and tassets removed. Tassets not impactful enough anymore</li>

        <li>Deadeye and mystic </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Version 1.3.0</h2>
